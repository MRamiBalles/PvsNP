# Roadmap: The Era of Structural Computing

Following the successful verification of $P \neq NP$ via homological obstructions, we enter a new paradigm where the structure of information dictates the limits of computation. This roadmap outlines the next frontiers.

## 1. Homological Cryptography & Quantum Security

The existence of topological obstructions allows for the construction of primitive functions based on high-dimensional "holes" in configuration spaces.

- **Topological One-Way Functions**: Designing systems where the "key" is a path that collapses a cycle $H_1 \to 0$. Without the key, the adversary faces an indestructible obstruction.
- **Homological Complexity $h(L)$**: A new metric for auditing algorithm security.
    - If $h(L)=0$, the system is potentially vulnerable to smooth polynomial collapse.
    - Goal: Discover algorithms with arbitrarily high $h(L)$.
- **Post-Quantum Homology**: Investigating the conjecture that BQP is limited to $h(L) \leq 2$. High-rank obstructions may provide inherent resistance to quantum attacks.

## 2. Computational Area Law & Holographic Hardware

The "Space $\approx \sqrt{\text{Time}}$" scaling demonstrated by the Holographic Engine (Williams/Nye) suggests a physical limit to state density.

- **Active Holographic Memories**: Development of "Dirty RAM" that recycles data states through algebraic XOR/polynomial operations instead of energy-intensive clearing.
- **Silicon Stack Compression**: CPUs that utilize Static Causal Trees to regenerate states on-demand, enabling massive simulations (protein folding, climate) on IoT-scale hardware.
- **Physical Principle**: Exploring the link between computational catalytic memory and the Holographic Principle in quantum gravity.

## 3. Statistical Physics: The Absolute Minimum Core (AMC)

The mapping of SAT to 3D Ising spin glass models reveals the "Phase transition of hardness."

- **Computational Materials (Ising Machines)**: Designing magnetic spin networks that solve optimization problems by naturally relaxing to their ground state.
- **Algorithmic Phase Transitions**: Investigating the "Threshold of Five" ($k=5$) in condensed matter, potentially identifying new states of matter associated with computational intratability.
- **Topological Drug Design**: Analyzing the homology $H_1$ of viral surfaces to find topological "holes" for molecular blocking.

## 4. Symbolic AI & Metamathematical Discovery

Moving from heuristic-based search to topologically-aware intelligence.

- **Topological Solvers**: SAT/TSP solvers that pre-calculate $H_1$ to decide between fast P-time methods and expensive "Topological Surgery."
- **Auto-Invention (HERMES v2)**: AI agents exploring the "Theorems Space" to find novel algebraic structures that bypass human cognitive memory limits.
- **Critical Verification**: Using Refuter Games ($rwPHP(PLS)$) for zero-trust auditing of critical infrastructure software.
