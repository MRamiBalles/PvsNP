# SCO v2.0: Transition Memorandum - "The Proof Agenda"

> **Status**: v1.0 Certified | v2.0 Initial Planning
> **From**: SCO Instrument (v1.0)
> **To**: Geometric Obstructions & Meta-Complexity Research (v2.0)

## 🏗️ 1. Accomplishments of SCO v1.0 (The Instrument)

The first stage provided the necessary substrate for complex observation:
- **Holographic Engine (ARE)**: Verified space-time tradeoff at $O(\sqrt{T})$.
- **Area Law Validation**: Empirically confirmed the boundary information density.
- **Hybrid Oracle Architecture**: Integrated ML into symbolic verification loops.
- **Epistemic Infrastructure**: Built a ledger to track high-confidence pillars.

## 🔭 2. Objectives for SCO v2.0 (The Research)

The second stage will use the v1.0 tools to attack the $P$ vs $NP$ problem through the "Geometric and Meta-Complexity" flumes.

### A. The Kronecker Obstruction (GCT)
**Focus**: Lee's "Five Threshold" ($k=5$).
- **Goal**: Implement a search for quadratic obstructions in polynomial orbit closures.
- **Mechanism**: Use the `TFNP Classifier` to map SAT instances into representational modules. Detect the emergence of irreducibility at $k=5$.

### B. Hardness Magnification Pipeline
**Focus**: MCSP (Minimum Circuit Size Problem).
- **Goal**: Prove that ARE-based compression of SAT implies super-polynomial lower bounds.
- **Mechanism**: Establish a formal link between the `Holographic Engine`'s efficiency and circuit lower bounds via magnification theorems.

### C. Phase Transition Mapping
**Focus**: Topological Spin-Glass signatures.
- **Goal**: Differentiate 2-SAT and 3-SAT using non-relativizing topological invariants.
- **Mechanism**: Use the `Hybrid Oracle` to detect "knotted" configurations in the Turing machine tape state that signify hard instances.

## 🛠️ 3. Immediate Next Steps (Phase 24)

1. **New Repository/Branch Structure**: Maintain `v1.0-stable` and pivot development to `v2.0-research`.
2. **Lean 4 Formalization**: Start lifting the "Holographic Barrier" lemmas into Lean 4 for formal certification.
3. **Advanced Telemetry**: Enhance `Area Law Monitor` to detect algebraic rank rather than just payload size.

## 📜 4. Closing Statement for v1.0

*"We have built the telescope. We have verified the optics. Now, we point it towards the heart of the NP-completeness void to see what reflects back."*
